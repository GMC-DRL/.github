# :star2: Welcome to GMC team :star2:

## :sunglasses: Who is Us


We are a research team mainly focus on the [Evolutionary Computing](), [Deep Reinforcement Learning](), [Black Box Optimization]() and [Meta Black Box Optimization](). We belong to the Computational Intelligence Lab, School of Computer Science, South China University of Technology. (Our [homepage](https://gmc-drl.github.io/))

We are an energetic team including undergraduate students, master students and phd students. The student leader in this team is [Zeyuan Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jcy8wPgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a phd student at South China University of Technology. Students in GMC team are advised (in part advised) by [Prof. Yue-Jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). This is a pure research-oriented technical team, aiming to develop the new generation of black-box-optimization concepts, algorithms, frameworks and benchmarks. The resulting research domain is commonly named as Meta-Black-Box-Optimization, which generally mitigates the labour-intensive development in traditional black-box optimization algorithms through meta-learning an update rule/algorithmic configuration at the meta level. We believe works done in this team would promote the study edge of both evolutionary computing and optimization.
