# :star2: Welcome to GMC team :star2:

## :sunglasses: Who is Us


We are a research team mainly focus on the [Evolutionary Computing](), [Deep Reinforcement Learning](), [Black Box Optimization]() and [Meta Black Box Optimization](). We belong to the Computational Intelligence Lab, School of Computer Science, South China University of Technology. 

We are an energetic team including undergraduate students, master students and phd students. The student leader in this team is [Zeyuan Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jcy8wPgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a phd student at South China University of Technology. Students in GMC team are advised (in part advised) by [Prof. Yue-jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). This is a pure research-oriented technical team, aiming to develop the new generation of black-box-optimization concepts, algorithms, frameworks and benchmarks. The resulting research domain is commonly named as Meta-Black-Box-Optimization, which generally mitigates the labour-intensive development in traditional black-box optimization algorithms through meta-learning an update rule/algorithmic configuration at the meta level. We believe works done in this team would promote the study edge of both evolutionary computing and optimization.
